<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>

<p>
The earliest reference to the city is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE,
 found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the
  south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient Elamite name
  a city called Tiraziš. Phonetically, this is interpreted as. This name became
   Old Persian; through regular sound
  change comes the modern Persian name Shirāz.<br>
  The name Shiraz also appears on
  clay sealings found at a 2nd-century CE Sassanid ruin, east of the city.
   By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz has derived from a son of
    Tahmuras, the third Shāh (King) of the world according to Ferdowsi's Shāhnāma.<br>
